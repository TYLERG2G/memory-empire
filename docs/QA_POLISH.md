# QA polish (borrowed from teardown skill)

Source: https://github.com/elvarofficial/teardown (MIT)
Use after core build: screenshot review sheets + polish checklist.

## Review loop

You cannot watch the video; you can look at frames. Never report a machine as done without reading sheets of the current render.

1. `--stills beats`: one tile per timeline beat, 0.3 s after it, each labelled `t=`.
2. Read every tile against the checklist below.
3. Zoom in: `--stills every:0.2 --from A --to B` for a transition, `--still T` for one full frame.
4. Fix, rebuild, go back to 1. Stop when a full pass finds nothing.
5. Final: `node "$SKILL_DIR/sheet.mjs" --video <final.mp4> --timeline <timeline.json>` and read that too: it shows what the encoder wrote.

Checklist:

- **The mechanism.** Every part that should touch touches; nothing passes through anything; the numbers on the panels match the pose.
- **Composition.** One focal point per frame. Nothing important within 60 px of an edge. Labels never cover the part they name.
- **Type.** Nothing clipped. The key readout reads at phone width.
- **3D.** Bloom eats detail: keep emissive layers under 1.0. Near-white surfaces blow out. Glossy metal under a low light streaks: roughness ≥ 0.45 and envMapIntensity ≈ 0.5 on big surfaces.
- **Timing.** Each state holds long enough to read: 1 s for a short phrase plus 0.25 s per word beyond three.
